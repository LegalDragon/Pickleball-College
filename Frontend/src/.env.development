# Development Environment Configuration
# Used when running: npm run dev

# No API prefix needed - Vite proxy forwards controller routes directly
# VITE_API_URL is not set, so it defaults to empty string

# Alternative: Direct backend URL (bypasses proxy)
# VITE_API_URL=https://localhost:7009

# Remote API URL for development testing against deployed backend
# VITE_API_URL=https://casecapi.dink1.com
